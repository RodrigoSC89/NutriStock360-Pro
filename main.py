Visual Instructions (English, lightweight and restrictive):

Show only one realistic Platform Supply Vessel (PSV) floating on calm sea surface.

Camera: top-down view on a flat DP grid (thin green lines).

Do not render waves, splashes, smoke, or underwater details.

Use one glowing dot as the setpoint marker, fixed on the grid.

Vessel movement must be smooth and minimal.

Timeline:

[0–3s] PSV steady on grid. Setpoint glowing dot shifts slightly forward. Vessel moves quickly and overshoots beyond the dot.

[3–5s] Vessel corrects and slightly overshoots back past the dot → one small oscillation only.

[5–8s] Vessel stabilizes exactly on the glowing dot. A faint blue glow appears around the PSV, symbolizing stable DP.

⚠️ File size constraints (to keep <5MB):

Keep animations minimal and linear (one overshoot, one correction).

Background = plain calm sea with simple flat grid, no dynamic water.

Use only fade in/out and glow for effects (no particles, turbulence, or camera motion).

Vessel remains 2D/3D static model, only shifting smoothly on grid.
